# Horiseon-SEO-HW01
This repo contains Homework-01. The purpose of the homework was to refactor an existing site, to bring it in line with industry standards.

The steps taken to increase accessibility on this site include:

- Added alt tags to all images (including the background image in the hero).
- Added a concise title and meta description to the site to aid in SEO.
- Consolidated html classes and id's to make the code cleaner to read, and allowed me to write more efficient CSS.
- Added semantic HTML tags to aid in accessibility for the visually impaired, and search engine crawlers.
- Updated the links in the top-nav to ensure they were all redirecting as intended.
- I added comments to the styles.css file to clearly articulate what each line of code was influencing.
